git remote = will either tell you the remote repositories connected with a local git repository (no args) or with args (will create a remote repository link)
git remote add origin https://github.com/dmdietz75069/Udacity-HowToUseGitAndGitHub.git
git remote -v = gives remote 
git push origin <branch> to push

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you wanted to share and collaborate on your repository with the world you could create a public remote repository, and if you wanted to collaborate with a restricted group of users, you could make a private remote repository.
